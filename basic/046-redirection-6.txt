# Answer to exercise "4.6 Redirection 6"

The command "ls < ls > ls" results in the file "ls" being truncated (emptied) by the "> ls" 
redirection before the "ls" command actually executes. The shell prepares the output 
redirection first, which clears the file. The input redirection "< ls" then reads from 
the now-empty file, and the "ls" command simply lists the current directory contents 
into that same file.
