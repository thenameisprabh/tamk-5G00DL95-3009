# Answer to exercise "6.1 Meta character 1"

Step-by-step process:
1. The shell identifies the $(...) syntax, which triggers command substitution.
2. Inside the parentheses, "ls -la" executes first, listing all files (including hidden ones) in long format.
3. The output of "ls" is piped (|) into "wc -l", which counts the number of lines in that output.
4. The result of that count (a single number) replaces the $(...) block.
5. Finally, the "echo" command prints the full string with the included number.

The output will be: "The Result of this command is X ", where X is the number of entries in the current directory plus the total line and the "." and ".." entries.

# End of file
