# Answer to exercise "4.5 Redirection 5"

This command uses "stdin" redirection. The "<" symbol tells the shell to open "/var/log/dpkg.log" 
and feed its content into the "stdin" of the "less" command. The shell handles the file 
opening before "less" starts, so "less" reads the stream instead of opening the file itself.
