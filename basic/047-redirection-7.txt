# Answer to exercise "4.7 Redirection 7"

This uses a "Here Document" (<< EOF). The shell takes the lines following the command 
until it hits "EOF" and sends them to the "stdin" of the "cat" command. "cat" also 
tries to read "file" as an argument. The resulting output is then redirected 
from "stdout" (1>) into "file2".

# End of file
