# Answer to exercise "4.3 Redirection 3"

The file "2" is empty because "2>" is a redirection operator for "stderr" (file descriptor 2). 
In the command "echo 2 2> 2", the shell prints the character "2" to "stdout", but redirects 
any error messages ("stderr") into a file named "2". Since the echo command succeeded, 
no error was generated, leaving the file "2" created but empty.
