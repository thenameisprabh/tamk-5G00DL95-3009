Commands A and B both save the error message to a separate file. 
In both cases, "stdout" (1>) is sent to "file.tmp" and "stderr" (2>) is sent to "error.log". 
Command C fails because it tries to use "qwerty" as "stdin" (<), but the file does not exist, 
preventing the command from even starting correctly.

# End of file
