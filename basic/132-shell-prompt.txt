# Answer to exercise "13.2 The Shell prompt"

To set the Bash prompt permanently, you must modify the "PS1" variable in the "~/.bashrc" file. The specific escape sequences required for the requested format are:
- \h : Host name
- \! : Command history number
- \t : Current time (HH:MM:SS)
- \w : Current working directory (relative to home)

To achieve the format "[host history time] directory$", add the following line to your ~/.bashrc:

export PS1="[\h \! \t] \w$ "

After saving the file, run "source ~/.bashrc" to apply the changes immediately.

# End of file
