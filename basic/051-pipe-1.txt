# Answer to exercise "5.1 Pipe 1"

Numbers 1 and 4 do not make sense in practice.

1. "cat file | ls > file": This is illogical because "ls" does not read from "stdin". 
The content of "file" is piped to "ls", but "ls" ignores it and simply lists 
directory contents, overwriting the original "file" in the process.

4. "ls | less > cat file": This syntax is broken. The ">" operator expects a 
single filename to write to. Here, the shell would try to write to a file named 
"cat" and then pass "file" as an extra argument to "less", which is not how 
redirection is intended to work.

# End of file
